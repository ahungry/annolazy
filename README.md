# Annolazy

## A lazy way to generate annotations in many languages

Currently working on the PHP implementation.

The idea is that you can just point the program at your source
directory and have docblocks auto-generated and formatted according to
a nice standard/convention, saving the programmer a lot of time in
manu comment editing.
